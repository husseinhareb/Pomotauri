Simply set the duration for each Pomodoro session, short break, and long break, and the timer will notify you when it's time to switch tasks.

### Managing Tasks
Each task has its own timer, which can tell you how much time you've been working on that task. You can simply pick the working task by clicking on it. Once it's done, you can check it off or delete it.
